    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>How it started</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our drug page! As part of a school project, we were asked to use
      and visulaize some of the data available on popular databases, focusing on Wikidata.
      We decided to docus mainly on drug information, allowing users to see the affective dose,
      lethal dose in mice and humans, some articles and clinical trials and other information
      available on the Wikidata. It is estimated that everyday tens of thousands of Americans overdose on
      over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen), and Benadryl.
      This is what makes readily accessible and reliable drug data so important.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Whats next?</h2>
    <p>We hope to expand our information to beyond WikiData, to include information off of
      DrugBank, PubChem, ChEmBL, OpenCitations and others. This would let us integrate much more information onto our page.</p>
